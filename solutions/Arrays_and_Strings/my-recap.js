/**
 * One very important feature of Array is Random-Access, which allows us to directly 
 * access any arbitrary element in a sequence in the constant time. If any chance
 * can be found for a given problem, where we can use Random-Access, we should take
 * advantage of that chance without hesitation.
 * 
 * From my POV, Hash-Table is a pretty efficient DS that applys the idea of Array's
 * Random-Access. Behind the scene such a DS sees everything in the world as an 
 * ORDERED WAY, or everything can be seen in such an ordered way. If arbitrary elements
 * has a chance to be sorted in some manner, then they can be stored in Array, and
 * Random-Access is hence able to be employed to improve the computing efficiency.
