/**
 * One very important feature of Array is Random-Access, which allows us to directly 
 * access any arbitrary element in a sequence in the constant time. If any chance
 * can be found for a given problem, where we can use Random-Access, we should take
 * advantage of that chance without hesitation.
 * 
 * Hash-Table is a pretty efficient DS. Behind the scene such a DS sees everything 
 * in this world as an ORDERED WAY, or everything can be seen in such an ordered way. 
 * From my POV it applys the idea of Array's Random-Access. If arbitrary elements
 * has a chance to be sorted in some manner, then they can be stored in Array, and
 * Random-Access is hence able to be employed to improve the computing efficiency.
